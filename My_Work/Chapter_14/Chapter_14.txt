-- Chapter 14: Analyzing Spatial Data with PostGIS

-- 1. Earlier, you found which US county has the largest area. Now,
-- aggregate the county data to find the area of each state in square
-- miles. (Use the statefp10 column in the us_counties_2010_shp table.)
-- How many states are bigger than the Yukon-Koyukuk area?

-- Answer: Just three states are bigger than Yukon-Koyukuk: Of course,
-- one is Alaska itself (FIPS 02). The other two are Texas (FIPS 48),
-- and California (FIPS 06).

SELECT statefp10 AS st,
       round (
              ( sum(ST_Area(geom::geography) / 2589988.110336))::numeric, 2
             ) AS square_miles
FROM us_counties_2010_shp
GROUP BY statefp10
ORDER BY square_miles DESC;

-- 2. Using ST_Distance(), determine how many miles separate these two farmers’
-- markets: the Oakleaf Greenmarket (9700 Argyle Forest Blvd, Jacksonville,
-- Florida) and Columbia Farmers Market (1701 West Ash Street, Columbia,
-- Missouri). You’ll need to first find the coordinates for both in the
-- farmers_markets table.
-- Tip: you can also write this query using the Common Table Expression syntax
-- you learned in Chapter 12.

-- Answer: About 851 miles.

WITH
    market_start (geog_point) AS
    (
     SELECT geog_point
     FROM farmers_markets
     WHERE market_name = 'The Oakleaf Greenmarket'
    ),
    market_end (geog_point) AS
    (
     SELECT geog_point
     FROM farmers_markets
     WHERE market_name = 'Columbia Farmers Market'
    )
SELECT ST_Distance(market_start.geog_point, market_end.geog_point) / 1609.344 -- convert to meters to miles
FROM market_start, market_end;

-- 3. More than 500 rows in the farmers_markets table are missing a value
-- in the county column, an example of dirty government data. Using the
-- us_counties_2010_shp table and the ST_Intersects() function, perform a
-- spatial join to find the missing county names based on the longitude and
-- latitude of each market. Because geog_point in farmers_markets is of the
-- geography type and its SRID is 4326, you’ll need to cast geom in the Census
-- table to the geography type and change its SRID using ST_SetSRID().

-- Answer:

SELECT census.name10,
       census.statefp10,
       markets.market_name,
       markets.county,
       markets.st
FROM farmers_markets markets JOIN us_counties_2010_shp census
    ON ST_Intersects(markets.geog_point, ST_SetSRID(census.geom,4326)::geography)
    WHERE markets.county IS NULL
ORDER BY census.statefp10, census.name10;

-- Note that this query also highlights a farmer's market that is mis-geocoded.
-- Can you spot it?
